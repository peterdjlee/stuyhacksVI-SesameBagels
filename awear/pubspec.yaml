  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
      - family: Raleway
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
            style: italic

      - family: PlayfairDisplay
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-Regular.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-Italic.ttf
            style: italic
